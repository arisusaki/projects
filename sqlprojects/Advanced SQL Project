- - SQL QUERIES Instructions: Write a SELECT query for each of the questions/statements below.

-- 1. How many films were rented each year, grouped by year? (one query, group by year(rental_date))
SELECT year(rental_date) AS year, count(rental_id) AS num_of_films 
FROM rental 
GROUP BY year(rental_date);

- - 2. How many films were rented every month, grouped by month, in 2005? (one query, group by month(rental_date)). Note that you will only get results for May through December.
SELECT month(rental_date) AS month, count(rental_id) AS num_of_films 
FROM rental 
WHERE YEAR(rental_date) = '2005' 
GROUP BY month(rental_date) 
ORDER BY month;

- - 3. Using the customer_list VIEW, display a summary for the number of customers in each country.
SELECT country, count(*) AS num_of_customers 
FROM customer_list 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY num_of_customers;

- - 4. Using the customer_list VIEW, display a summary for the number of customers in each country, limited to those countries with 10 or more customers.
SELECT country, count(*) AS num_of_customers 
FROM customer_list 
GROUP BY country 
HAVING num_of_customers >= 10 
ORDER BY num_of_customers DESC;

- - 5. Using the customer_list VIEW, display a summary for the number of customers in each city, limited to those cities with customers who have a name starting with S.
SELECT city, count(*) AS num_of_customers 
FROM customer_list 
WHERE name like 'S%' 
GROUP BY city 
ORDER BY num_of_customers;

- - DDL QUERIES Create a table named order with the following fields and data types: (see https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp

Links to an external site.). Note that you need to use ` around order because it is otherwise a SQL keyword.

            order_id as an integer and primary key, with auto_increment
            order_date as datetime and not null (optional default as now())
            cust_name as a varchar(100) and not null
            product_name as a varchar(50) and not null
            product_price as decimal(10,2) and not null
            quantity as integer and not null


1. CREATE DATABASE my_shop

2. CREATE TABLE `order` (
  `order_id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `order_date` datetime NOT NULL,
  `cust_name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `product_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `product_price` decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
